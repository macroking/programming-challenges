Greedy Algorithms
    To find a localized optimum solution, which may eventually lead to globally optimized solutions. However, generally greedy algorithms do not provide globally optimized solutions.

        Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
        Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm

Divide and Conquer
    Dividing the given problem into smaller sub-problems and then solving each of the sub-problem independently. When the problem can not be further sub divided, we start merging the solution to each of the sub-problem to arrive at the solution for the bigger problem
